Air China launches first non-stop flight to Brisbane,2025-05-30 18:48:03,China Daily,China,"The first non-stop flight connecting China with Brisbane, the habitat of the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, will depart from Beijing on Monday early morning, benefiting tourists from both countries. Air China’s CA 795 will leave Beijing at 2:30 am and arrive about 11 hours later in Brisbane, Queensland, at 15:10 local time. China’s flagship carrier will operate four services every week on Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. Brisbane will become Air China’s third destination in Australia, after Sydney and Melbourne. Previously it used to take 12 hours and 30 minutes from Beijing to Queensland with one-transfer. “The establishment of this new route is part of Air China’s global expansion of its route network and improvement of links between China and Australia,” said Hou Xulun, deputy head of Air China. “The launch of the non-stop route between Beijing and Brisbane will provide a convenient transport link that will enhance bilateral trade, business cooperation and tourism,” he added. The carrier now handles over 40 weekly passenger flights between China and Australia. The fast growth in direct flight between China and Australia has been underpinned by the landmark Australia-China open air services agreement, signed a year ago, said Jan Adams, Australian ambassador to China. Brisbane in Queensland is a major tourism destination, with the Gold Coast and the Great Barrier Reef the favorite spots.
